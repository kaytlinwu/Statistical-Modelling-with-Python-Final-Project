# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
The goal of this project is to make a model comparing the Foursquare API and the YELP API in regards to bike stations that were pulled from the city bikes API. The model's goal was to ......
## Process
The first step of the project was selecting a city and getting data from the city bikes API pertaining to the bike stations, latitude, longitude, and number of bikes. 
Then we looked at these stations using YELP and Foursquare API to gain insights to restuarants etc.
